\subsection{Lecture Notes - Lagrange Multipliers}
\subsubsection{Motivation}
How do you deal with a problem with constraints. Before, we had a method with generalized coordinates, obtain an EoM for each of them. But sometimes we might be interested in the constraint force itself. For this, we turn to the method of Lagrange multipliers (which have much broader use than mechanics!)
